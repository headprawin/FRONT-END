        <h3>JOEL MURPHY</h3>
        <b>
            How did you get into animation? Was it your goal as soon
            as you began to draw, or did the enthusiasm for animation
            come later?
        </b>
        <p>
            According to a family story, my first movie experience is
            connected to 101 Dalmatians. I have been drawing ever
            since my childhood. But although I completed my studies at
            secondary school in graphics, it never occurred to me to be
            a cartoon animator. I was already devoted to films at that
            time, and thought perhaps I should move in this direction.

            I can thank a small matter that I'm in the wonderful world of
            animation today: Back in my hometown, Szeged, my mother
            noticed a small ad in the daily newspaper about an
            upcoming animation course at the nearby cartoon studio in
            Kecskemét (Kecskemétfilm). After a previous winnowing,
            there was an entrance exam that I passed. The course
            lasted for a couple of months, and during this period did I
            start to pay attention to animated films more seriously
        </p>

            <b>We all know that an animator s desk is full of toys. What do you have surrounding you?</b>
            <p>Hahah! :) I love toys! I cannot deny, when a new animated film is at the cinema, I'm always there
                in those fast food restaurants, standing in the queue of children, trying to get hold of the toys
                they offer with the children's menu. Just one more thing, on my first trip abroad I took the
                fluorescent eyed Mike Wazowski with me. The toys won't let me diverge from my childhood
                and ease everyday life.</p>
